# Face Finder Local

**_Created By [Abhin](https://github.com/abhin-T) & Mohit_**

**Project Begun on Aug 8th 2022**

This web application is built using the React framework, along with various libraries such as
Bootstrap. We use a face sorting algorithm from "https://justadudewhohacks.github.io/face-api.js/docs/index.html" 
to help our application to allow users to upload an image to determine who the celebrity is then displays it to the user.

## After Git Cloning the React Application from git

check if the package.json file is good, specifically the scripts
then you delete the package-lock.json
then delete any existing node module folders
after this in the terminal enter 'npm install'
after the install it should be good to go

## For Viewing the Markdown README File

install the markdown viewing extension (markdown preview enhanced |or| markdown all in one)
